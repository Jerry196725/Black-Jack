# Black-Jack

Team G: Jeremy Jun

This program plays the game of Blackjack that also shows the player's probability of winning.

1. As you start the program it will start right away by giving you 2 cards and display your probability of winning based off the cards you have.
2. You are given 4 choices hit, stand, double, and split.
3. If you choose hit or double, you will get a new card that will change the probability and show a new one.
4. You can only split if you have 2 cards that have the same number. ex. {10, 10}, {3, 3}.
5. When you choose to stand, your turn is over and it will be the dealers turn.
6. The dealer must hit if the card's value is less than 16 and must stand on 17 or more.
7. After the dealer's turn is over the score will come out and deterimne who the winner is.
